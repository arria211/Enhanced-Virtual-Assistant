# Enhanced-Virtual-Assistant

This project includes a React frontend created with Create React App and a minimal Express backend.

## Getting Started

### Frontend

From the project root run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend

Navigate to the `server` directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend listens on port `4000` and exposes simple `/api/signup` and `/api/login` routes stored in `server/index.js`.

## Testing

Run `npm test` to execute the React test suite.
